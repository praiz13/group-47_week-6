Task 3:Ethics in personalized medicine 
Title: Resolving Prejudice in AI-Powered Customized Healthcare 
By offering tailored treatment suggestions based on patient-specific information including genetics, medical history, and lifestyle, artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential to completely transform the healthcare industry.  However, there are serious ethical issues with the application of AI in personalized medicine, especially with regard to prejudice and equity in clinical judgment.  The underrepresentation of minority and ethnic groups in databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a major cause for worry.  The majority of AI models are trained using data from people of European ancestry, which results in biased algorithms that could provide recommendations for underrepresented groups that are less accurate or even dangerous.For instance, genetic diversity can make a treatment strategy that works well for one genetic group dangerous or ineffective for another.  One important tactic to lessen these biases is to make sure that training datasets are representative and varied.  This entails actively obtaining clinical and genetic data from a broad spectrum of socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural origins.  Furthermore, discrepancies in prediction results can be found and fixed with the use of routine audits and performance assessments of AI models across subgroups.  Using explainable AI (XAI) to make treatment recommendations transparent is another crucial tactic.  It is simpler to recognize and challenge biased reasoning when both patients and doctors are aware of the decision-making process.Additionally, model pipelines can incorporate fairness-aware machine learning methods like equalized odds post-processing, adversarial debiasing, or re-weighting to account for skewed distributions in training data.  In conclusion, even if AI provides strong instruments for improving customized medicine, it is crucial to guarantee inclusion, equity, and transparency.  AI may inadvertently exacerbate rather than lessen health inequities if conscious measures are not made to eliminate data bias.
